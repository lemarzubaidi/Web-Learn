hidden treasure chest buried under a large oak tree. Inside the chest, he found a map that led to a secret part of the forest where no animal had ever ventured. With excitement and

 reached the secret part of the forest, where he found a beautiful meadow hilled with the most delicious nuts and berries. Sammy shared his discovery with the other animals, and they
